This code is an implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, used to solve pseudo-optimally the Traveling Salesman Problem.

Since this is a stochastic algorithm, the output will vary each time it is run. However, with the control parameters we set, one may expect to obtain a cost anywhere between 40k and 50k (most of the time).

The output will show the final solution path obtained with its cost, as well as a table containing the info for each iteration of the Simulated Annealing (stored in the file 'simulated_annealing_data.csv').
